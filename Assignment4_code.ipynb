Essentially, the most common optimisation algorithms are nothing more than variants of gradient descent. Although it is often claimed that stochastic gradient descent outperforms any adaptive learning method when carefully configured, it is often more convenient to use a method that requires less tuning."

    "Rather than using plain gradient descent algorithm, a stochastic variant is used to train neural networks. This variant is known as *Stochastic Gradient Descent*, or *SGD* for short. Although this naming scheme seems to suggest that stochasticity is part of the algorithm, it is actually introduced by how we use the data to compute gradients.\n",

    "Instead of computing the gradients over the entire dataset in one go, the samples in the dataset are split up in more manageable pieces called *mini-batches*. This can speed up the computations significantly and avoids memory problems with very large datasets. Another benefit from mini-batches is that they introduce variation, or *stochasticity*, in the gradient computations. After all, the gradient for each mini-batch will be different to the gradient for other mini-batches or for all samples. This stochasticity can be useful to escape local minima in the optimisation process. To amplify this stochasticity, it is also common to shuffle the samples in the dataset so that mini-batches consist of different samples.\n",

    "##### Some Notes on python generators\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, a [generator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators) is a function with some state that can return multiple values. You probably have already used generators without realising it. Probably, the most famous generator is `range`, which could be defined as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def _range(start, stop, step=1):\n",
    "    i = start\n",
    "    while i < stop:\n",
    "        yield i\n",
    "        i += step\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `yield` keyword. This has a similar effect as `return` in that it provides a value to the outer scope of the function. However, it does not cause the function to be exited. Instead, the current state in the function is stored until the next value is requested. To get the return values of a generator, there are essentially two options:\n",
    " 1. Using the `next` function. This will simply run the function until the next `yield` statement and give back the yielded value.\n",
    " 2. By iterating over the generator in any way. This will consequently call `next` on the generator until the function exits.\n",

    "Momentum already provides a way to reduce the importance of the gradient magnitude. \n",
    "With adaptive learning rate methods, an attempt is made to ignore most of the magnitude information and the size of the update is mainly controlled by controlling the learning rate. \n",
    "One of the most popular first order adaptive methods in practice, is the Adam optimiser.\n",
    "However, Adam also has a sibling called *Adamax* that typically performs on a similar level.\n",

    "To understand Adamax, we have to look at the variance as a rescaled $L_2$ norm.\n",
    "Instead of dividing by the $L_2$ norm, as it is done in Adam, Adamax divides by the $L_\\inf$ norm.\n",
    "This gives rise to the following updates for first and second moment estimates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    \\boldsymbol{m}^{(t)} &= \\beta_1 \\boldsymbol{m}^{(t-1)} + (1 - \\beta_1) \\boldsymbol{g}^{(t)} \\\\\n",

    "It would have been silly to do all of this work to train logistic regression.\n",
    "Something you probably already would have been able to do before the start of this course.\n",
    "The real goal is to train *deep* networks with multiple layers.\n",
    "You probably can't wait to build a convolutional network with your framework!\n",

    "> Use one of the optimisers from above to train a multi-layer convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset. \n",
    "> Feel free to also create new modules and try out new things! (make sure to include any new code in the notebook!).\n",
    "> Achieve a model with 80% accuracy to collect all points. \n",
